Welcome!  My name is **Justin Le**.  I'm a final-year undergraduate student at
University of California, San Diego, studying Computational Physics and
Computer Science.

This is just my weblog covering my various adventures in programming and
explorations in the vast worlds of computation, physics, and knowledge. Expect
a healthy curiosity and an only slightly unhealthy obsession for finding ways
to understand this big world.  Join me if you wish!
